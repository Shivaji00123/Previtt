# Prewitt:
The Prewitt operator is a simple edge detection technique used in image processing. It detects edges in an image by computing the gradient of intensity at each pixel. The Prewitt filter is based on convolution masks and is similar to the Sobel operator, but it uses a simpler approach for gradient calculation.
